# gas-station-mngt
This is a gas station management website made by creating and using a template-kind website, of Canco Gas Station, as a Base. Apart from the basic functionalities of a gas station website, this website will add certain new features: The major changes we would like to make will be ease to look for daily updated gas and propane prices and a comparison section for users to check if they are cheaper then the other options available; There will be another page for certain special deals going on at that time; There will be constant monitoring by the manager or any one employee on contact us page; Also, there will be a chatbot on the same page where customers can ask any in-general queries they have and will get the response right away, saving their time to drive over to the gas station. Moreover, after a healthy visit, people can give an honest feedback in a section, that will help the managers and workers to be cheerful, motivated and more dedicated towards their work. Besides this, feedbacks will also encourage other people to give a visit and share their customer service experience as well. Compared to the current system of the company, this system will minimize human error and save work time. It will be more interactive and locally networked.
